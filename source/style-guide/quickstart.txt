Thank you for contributing to MongoDB content!

Don't worry if your job title doesn't include the word *writer*,
*information*, or *content*—your most important contribution is your
knowledge and expertise. Your willingness to share what you know with
users will help them to accomplish their goals and be successful.

The Documentation team is ready to help turn your contributions into
clear, concise, consistent, easy-to-read content for users. We do this,
in part, by adhering to the standards that are defined in this style
guide. The team doesn't expect contributors to know or adhere to all of
these standards; however, if you are interested in improving your
writing or learning some of the style standards at MongoDB, we invite
you to explore them.

The style guide includes hundreds of standards, but you can start with
the following ones to help you boost the effectiveness of your writing.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 30 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Standard
     - Example 
     - More Information
   * - **Write in active voice**.

       Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the
       user) the subject of the sentence. Active-voice sentences are
       more direct and easier to understand than passive-voice
       sentences.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       The data your application receives can be filtered and transformed
       by specifying a set of aggregation operators.

       **Correct:**

       You can specify a set of aggregation operators to filter and transform
       the data your application receives.
     - :ref:`use-active-voice`
   * - **Use present tense**.

       Users read content to help them perform tasks or to gather
       information. These activities occur in the users' present
       time, so the present tense is appropriate in most content.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       After you have dropped an index, the system returns information about
       the status of the operation.

       **Correct:**
       
       After you drop an index, the system returns information about the
       status of the operation.
     - :ref:`use-present-tense`
   * - **Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood**.

       Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them
       directly. You talk to users directly by using second person,
       addressing the user as *you*. When you use second person with
       the imperative mood (in which the subject *you* is understood)
       *and* active voice, you make the text clear, concise, and
       direct.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       Developers can use the ``insert_one()`` method to insert a single
       document into a collection.

       **Correct:**
       
       Use the ``insert_one()`` method to insert a single document into a
       collection.
     - :ref:`write-to-the-user`
   * - **Write short sentences and paragraphs, and use lists whenever
       possible**.

       Even a well-written long sentence can be hard to follow and
       understand, so try to limit sentences to 25 words. Short
       paragraphs are easier to scan and understand than longer ones.
       When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of
       embedding the items in a paragraph.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       The following example finds all documents with ``"Pizza"`` in the
       ``cuisine`` field, sets the ``BatchSize`` to ``3``, and stores the
       results in a cursor.

       **Correct:**
       
       The following example performs these actions:

       - Finds all documents with ``"Pizza"`` in the ``cuisine`` field
       - Sets the ``BatchSize`` to ``3``
       - Stores the results in a cursor
     - :ref:`write-clear-concise-sentences-paragraphs`
   * - **Use action-oriented verbs**.

       Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your content
       come alive for users. To make the biggest impact with your
       writing, use strong, simple, action verbs.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       Look for the **Create Database User** button and select it to save
       the user.

       **Correct:**
       
       Click **Create Database User** to save the user.
     - :ref:`use-effective-verbs`
   * - **Write clear and brief step text**.

       When you write instructions for users, write short steps, number them,
       and use active voice and imperative mood.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       To create a free cluster through the Atlas UI, users should log in to
       Atlas first. Then, users can navigate to the *Database Deployments* page
       for your project. Finally, they can click *Build a Database*.

       **Correct:**
       
       To create a free cluster through the Atlas UI:

       1. Log in to Atlas.
       2. Navigate to the *Database Deployments* page for your project.
       3. Click *Build a Database*.
     - :ref:`tasks`
   * - **Clarify pronouns**.

       Pronouns  such as *it*, *this*, *there*, and *that* are useful,
       but you must ensure that their antecedents (the words that they
       are used in place of) are clear, and that they (the pronouns)
       don’t cause vagueness and ambiguity.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       To count the number of documents that match your query filter, use
       the ``CountDocuments()`` method. If you pass an empty query filter, *this*
       returns the total number of documents in the collection.

       **Correct:**
       
       To count the number of documents that match your query filter, use
       the ``CountDocuments()`` method. If you pass an empty query filter, *this
       method* returns the total number of documents in the collection.
     - :ref:`use-pronouns-carefully`
   * - **Use correct punctuation**.

       Use periods to end most sentences, avoid quotation marks, and
       use serial commas.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       Use the ``$or``, ``$in`` and ``$geoWithin`` operators with partial indexes
       on a time series collection

       **Correct:**
       
       Use the ``$or``, ``$in``, and ``$geoWithin`` operators with partial indexes
       on a time series collection.
     - :ref:`use-correct-punctuation`

       :ref:`punctuation`
   * - **Use AP headline-style capitalization for all titles and
       headings**.

       To meet AP headline-style (or AP title case) capitalization requirements, 
       refer to the guidelines in the :ref:`titles-and-headings` guide.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       *Retrieve distinct values of a field*

       **Correct:**
       
       *Retrieve Distinct Values of a Field*
     - :ref:`titles-and-headings`
   * - **Write clear and consistent code examples**.

       When you create blocks of code as input or output examples,
       follow some basic guidelines to make them clear to users.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       Use ``dpkg`` to install mongosh by running
       ``sudo dpkg -i mongodb-mongosh_{put version and platform here}.deb``
       on your command line.

       **Correct:**
       
       Use ``dpkg`` to install mongosh:

       .. code-block:: bash

          sudo dpkg -i mongodb-mongosh_<mongosh-version-and-platform>.deb
     - :ref:`code-examples`
   * - **Use consistent and simple terminology**.

       Use short, simple words, and use them as they are defined in a
       general or accepted industry dictionary. Each word or phrase
       should have only one meaning that is used consistently
       throughout the content. Avoid using humor, jargon, and
       metaphors.
     - **Incorrect:**
       
       Execute the following command in the shell to fire up the source connector
       using the configuration file you created.

       **Correct:**
       
       Run the following command in the shell to start the source connector
       using the configuration file you created.
